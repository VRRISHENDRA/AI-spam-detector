# ABSTRACT 
Spam emails are a pervasive nuisance and a serious security concern for users worldwide. These 
unwanted messages not only clutter inboxes but also pose risks such as phishing attacks, malware 
distribution, and identity theft. Traditional spam detection methods, often reliant on rule-based filters 
or simple keyword matching, struggle to keep pace with the ever-evolving tactics employed by 
spammers. 
 
To tackle this challenge, a cutting-edge solution has been proposed: an AI-based spam detection 
system leveraging machine learning algorithms for superior efficacy. Unlike conventional methods, 
this system harnesses the power of advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to 
comprehensively analyze email content, extracting nuanced features indicative of spam.
